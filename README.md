## Motivation

Given the surge in research related to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems, effective collaboration among researchers within specific subdomains of artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly crucial. The website is designed to bridge this need by facilitating connections between researchers from various faculties at Carleton University and problem owners, all with the goal of promoting collaboration in research.

The ongoing development of the website employs an innovative web scraping strategy using Beautiful Soup, a Python tool for parsing HTML documents. This technique enables the extraction of data from diverse Carleton faculty pages. The collected information is stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format within Firebase's real-time database. This dataset encompasses details like researchers' contact information, research interests, publications, and their respective affiliations. The website's front end was built using React, TailWindCSS, and a few DaisyUI components to create an easy-to-use user interface.

With the vision of creating a platform for problem owners to connect with researchers, the website must effectively perform as a comprehensive database with an intelligent search function. This entails robust search and querying capabilities that can interpret user intent and provide relevant outcomes. The initial state of the website employed a rudimentary search algorithm, specifically the exact-match keyword search. The objective of this project was to enhance the effectiveness of the search function. This can be achieved through numerous sophisticated search algorithms such as fuzzy search, page-rank search (Google's primary search algorithm), natural-language search, semantic search, and more. Given the maturity of research and application in natural language processing (NLP), this project will focus on improving the website's search functionality through NLP techniques such as natural-language search and semantic search [Rajput, 2020].

Semantic search transcends the limitations of exact keyword matches by comprehending each search query's context and underlying meaning. Implementing a semantic search algorithm can help identify correlated concepts and synonyms, resulting in more pertinent outcomes aligned with user intent. It heavily relies on word embeddings, a fundamental NLP concept, to grasp queries and deliver similar results that might be phrased differently. Word embeddings represent words as numerical vectors in a multidimensional space, where the angle or distance between vectors signifies the semantic proximity of words [Sieg, 2019].

The project's objective revolves around enhancing the website's existing search capabilities by integrating semantic search and natural language search algorithms. This will significantly enrich user experience and empower problem owners and researchers to more effectively collaborate and advance ethical AI research.

## Methodology

### System Architecture

A web application can be categorized into two primary functionalities: the front end and the back end. The front end encompasses the visual components that users interact with, while the back end is responsible for managing the website's structure, data, and logic.

The design approach for this project was strongly influenced by the inherent nature of the final web application. A critical requirement was to ensure compatibility with a React front-end application while delivering prompt and precise search results. To achieve this, a backend Application Programming Interface (API) was developed, enabling seamless communication between the front end and back end.

Another influence on the software architecture stemmed from the work of a previous student who created a web scraper. This tool extracted information from diverse faculty web pages, including names, departments, contact details, and research interests. The collected data was then transformed into JSON format and uploaded to Firebase's Realtime Database, accessible via API calls. These calls encompass actions such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting dataâ€”collectively referred to as CRUD actions. This client-server interaction entails the client sending requests to the server, which responds with the required data or an error message.

This laid the foundation for developing a solution. With parsed data residing in Firebase's Realtime Database, the ReactJS-based front end, and the need for a versatile backend API, Python emerged as the language of choice. Python's capabilities extended to seamless Firebase communication, a diverse array of data manipulation tools, Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. It also offered simple backend server hosting through the Flask web framework.

### Tokenization
Tokenization, a fundamental process, involves dissecting text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, subwords, or even characters. For instance, consider the sentence "The quick fox jumped over the lazy dog." In this context, each word constitutes a token, and within each word, individual letters serve as tokens. Consequently, text is parsed into paragraphs, paragraphs into sentences, sentences into words, and words into letters. This breakdown facilitates preprocessing, enabling us to focus solely on the pertinent content. The tokenization at the character level assumes particular significance, as it empowers the removal of punctuation and extraneous symbols. Tokenizing at the word level, on the other hand, permits the identification of keywords while excluding insignificant words such as articles (a, the) and prepositions. The division of paragraphs into sentences aids in grasping the holistic narrative by identifying meaningful phrases. As part of preprocessing, both our corpus and search query underwent punctuation and stop word removal prior to executing exact match searches. The ensuing search methods encompassed exact match searches for the entire query, bigram exact match searches, and trigram exact match searches. The latter two techniques fall under the umbrella of tokenization's subcategory known as n-grams [Pai, 2020]

### N-Grams
In natural language processing, n-grams are contiguous sequences of n items, where an "item" can refer to a word, character, or even a subword. N-grams capture local linguistic patterns and contextual information within a text [Pai, 2020]. They are very useful for identifying the keywords and phrases within a text. The "n" in n-grams represents the number of items in the sequence. A sentence like "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" serves as an illustrative example. Depending on the chosen "n" value, the following n-grams emerge:

1. Unigrams (1-grams):
   - "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."

2. Bigrams (2-grams):
   - "The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox", "fox jumps", "jumps over", "over the", "the lazy", "lazy dog."

3. Trigrams (3-grams):
   - "The quick brown", "quick brown fox", "brown fox jumps", "fox jumps over", "jumps over the", "over the lazy", "the lazy dog."

The utility of n-grams extends across numerous NLP tasks, including information retrieval. A devised algorithm facilitated the culling of bigrams and trigrams from the tokenized search query, which underwent preprocessing involving stop word elimination and punctuation removal. This iterative approach heightened the precision of exact match searches by accounting for partial query matches within the corpus.

### Semantic Search Algorithm and Text Embedding Models
Having established the system architecture overview, the focus shifted to devising an effective search algorithm. Thorough research was conducted to explore potential solutions for refining the search functionality. The primary goal was to enhance the search bar's ability to comprehend user intent. This involved utilizing a trained NLP model for query analysis and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the corpusâ€”the data being searched. Once the user's intent was deciphered, the challenge lay in locating relevant information. This was achieved by parsing JSON data to identify exact, partial, and related matches based on the query. Ultimately, the search results need to be presented in a manner that is ranked according to query relevance.

Initially, a plan was formulated to use SpaCy, an open-source NLP Python library, for text embedding. This approach entailed leveraging pre-trained word-vectorization methods to calculate embeddings for the corpus. However, further exploration revealed that SpaCy utilized Word2Vec, a technique dating back to 2013 [Mikolov et al, 2013]. Given the rapid evolution of AI/ML and NLP research in the past decade, this represented a limitation.

Upon deeper investigation, two promising text embedding models emerged: the OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model and the HuggingFace instructor-xl model [Su et al, 2022]. The decision-making process on which model to employ was facilitated by the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The MTEB indicated that the instructor-xl model ranked seventh, while the text-embedding-ada-002 model secured the thirteenth position overall [Muennighoff et al, 2022].

To make a more informed choice, a minimum viable solution was implemented using research interest data for each faculty member from Firebase's Realtime Database as the corpus. Embeddings were calculated and stored locally for each research interest using both models. Fifteen test queries were generated to establish a baseline for evaluation.

The embeddings for each query and corpus, represented as numerical vectors, allowed relevance calculation using the cosine similarity equation. The below image (Figure 2) represents a multidimensional space where two vectors "Hi world" and "Hello world" lie. Using the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, we can interpret the distance between them or in other words, how closely related the two vectors are. This produces a numeric value between 0 and 1, where 1 signifies an exact match, and 0 suggests no relevance between the vectors.

Cosine similarity is calculated using the equation:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \cdot \|B\|}
\]
where:
\[
A &= \text{Vector } A \\
B &= \text{Vector } B \\
\|A\| &= \text{Magnitude of vector } A \\
\|B\| &= \text{Magnitude of vector } B
\]

### Ranking Algorithm
Once a model was identified as the superior solution for our domain-specific task, a ranking algorithm was developed to provide the most pertinent information as top suggestions, prior to transmitting our results from the back end to the front end. This was accomplished through a hierarchy of rules: Exact matches were given priority over semantically similar ones. A tri-gram exact match took precedence over semantically similar search results for search phrases containing more than three words. To illustrate, consider the query "NLP for mining software repositories." The search process would begin with an exact match search for the entire query, followed by each bigram: "NLP for","for mining", "mining software", "software repositories"; followed by each trigram: "NLP for mining," "mining for software," and "mining software repositories." After exhausting the exact match search, the outcomes of the semantically similar search were appended to the results. This method ensures that only the most pertinent search results appear at the forefront.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines
In order to ensure that the website's search functionality works seamlessly, a back end server built using the Flask Python web framework would be hosted and deployed on the cloud-based micro-web service called Render. Render facilitates API hosting, enabling multiple endpoints to communicate with the back-end server through a single URL. On of the advantages of using a micro web service such as Render is that our code base can sit on a local machine while our deployment is over the cloud. This allows us to use version control tools such as git/GitHub to manage the different development, staging and production code without breaking our connection between the back end the front end. Anytime we commit new code to our production branch on GitHub, Render will automatically deploy the new code to the production server. Lastly, in order to update the embeddings on the database, a python script will be run when any of the faculty member's research interest changes. This ensures that the corpus is up to date.

## Results

### Testing Results

A methodical approach was employed to assess the accuracy of the two distinct models selected. The specifics of this assessment can be found in the methodology section of this report, and the table below (Table 1). For every model, the top five search results were individually categorized as relevant or irrelevant, and assigned a score of 1 or 0 respectively. Each model had the potential to achieve a maximum score of 5 for any given query. A cumulative count was then conducted for both models, and the resulting accuracy percentage was calculated.

| Query | HuggingFace Instructor-xl Model | OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algorithms | 5 | 5 |
| Biomedical Technology | 5 | 4 |
| Computational Theory | 4 | 4 |
| Computer Systems | 5 | 4 |
| Data Integrations and Data Analysis | 5 | 5 |
| Digital and Wireless Communication | 5 | 5 |
| Embedded Systems | 4 | 3 |
| Machine Learning | 4 | 4 |
| Network Security | 5 | 5 |
| Robotics | 4 | 4 |
| Social Media | 1 | 3 |
| Visualization | 3 | 4 |
| Web Development | 3 | 5 |
| Find me someone who can help with networks and software designs | 5 | 5 |
| Find me someone who can help with UI design | 4 | 5 |
| **Total Score** | **62** | **65** |

The instructor-xl model achieved a score of 62 out of 75, while the text-embedding-ada-002 obtained a score of 65 out of 75. Contrary to the MTEB leaderboard ranking, which positioned HuggingFace's instructor-xl text embedding model higher than OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, the domain-specific test demonstrated a different outcome.

| | HuggingFace Instructor-xl model | OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Accuracy | 61.59% | 60.99% |
| Website Testing Accuracy | 82.67% | 86.67% |

This demonstrated that OpenAI's text embedding model outperformed the HuggingFace text embedding model with a 4% greater accuracy. This improvement can be primarily attributed to one of the limitations identified during the testing of the instructor-xl model. The instructor-xl model exhibited a tendency to assign higher significance to research interests left blank by a faculty member, leading to a Type I error or a false positive. In contrast, OpenAI's model displayed effective performance by largely disregarding research interests lacking content. This phenomenon was particularly evident in the search query "Social Media".

### Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation is by no means flawless. The essence of crafting a search algorithm is rooted in the understanding that attaining perfection is an ongoing pursuit, given the potential for consistently enhancing search result accuracy. Three primary limitations can be discerned: constraints stemming from the data source, constraints stemming from the text embedding model, and constraints arising from the dependencies.

#### Limitations Arising from the Data Source

Data serves as the principal driving component for solutions implementing AI/ML and NLP. The efficacy of a solution is intricately tied to the quality of the data it operates upon. In this project, one of the primary constraints on achieving an exceptionally efficient solution emanates from the data source itself. If a faculty member fails to update their webpage, users of the website might encounter outcomes that do not accurately reflect their current research interests.

One potential approach to mitigate this challenge involves broadening our web scraping scope. Expanding beyond faculty webpages, we could incorporate data retrieval from recent publications, personal web pages of professors, and Google Scholar profiles. This strategic expansion would enhance the reliability and currency of the data underpinning our solution.

#### Limitations Arising from the Text Embedding Model

The query "Social Media" yielded results featuring professors who had not specified any research interests on their Carleton SCS faculty web page. This outcome can be attributed to the text embedding model giving greater importance to vacant research interest fields. This highlights a significant concept known as the black-box effect. As developers, when we employ such models, it's imperative to recognize that we may lack comprehensive insight into their internal workings. Consequently, every model carries its distinct limitations that may not always be fully comprehensible.

A plausible approach to address this concern involves leveraging multiple text embedding models. By scrutinizing their behaviors, we can construct a tailored text embedding pipeline that gives us the flexibility to assign greater weight to one model over another. This strategy helps us to navigate the intricacies of these models and mitigate their limitations effectively.

#### Limitations Arising from the Dependencies

Another limitation stems from the diverse array of tools, software, and libraries employed throughout this project. While everything currently operates smoothly, there remains the possibility that one of the dependencies could encounter issues due to version incompatibility, or some other reason. Furthermore, a distinct limitation originates from our chosen API hosting service, Render. The utilization of Render's free tier entails that our API server may undergo periodic downtime during prolonged periods of inactivity.

A potential remedy for both these constraints involves consistent website maintenance and the consideration of upgrading from the free tier. Such measures would serve to prevent downtime in the backend API server, ensuring uninterrupted functionality and a seamless user experience.

## Future Work

In light of the progress achieved through this project, several avenues for future work present themselves, some of which are geared towards enhancing our solution, while others extend beyond the project's scope, considering the diverse range of use cases that a generic solution could provide.

To start with, addressing the limitations stemming from the data source and broadening our web scraping scope would significantly enhance our solution, simultaneously simplifying the process for professors and providing more accurate results for users. Additionally, improving the accuracy of search results by employing multiple text embedding models and constructing a tailored hybrid embedding pipeline holds the potential for a superior solution. This endeavor also entails comprehending the behaviors, strengths, and limitations of each text embedding model. To amplify the user experience, the integration of advanced Natural Language Processing techniques like sentiment analysis, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) could facilitate conversational-level querying.

The problem statement at the core of this project can be distilled into a concise term: "Semantic text retrieval." This implies a wide spectrum of potential use cases for such a solution. The prospect of developing a versatile model that serves as a blueprint for creating custom, domain-specific text retrieval engines may assist a lot of different industries.

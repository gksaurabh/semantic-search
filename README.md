## Abstract

The goal for this project is to develop a website to facilitate collaboration among AI researchers and problem owners. This project enhances the website's search functionality by implementing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically tokenization methods, semantic and natural language search. The problem statement centers around building an intelligent search solution powered by OpenAI's text embedding model, utilizing NLP techniques to improve query comprehension and outcome relevance. The text embedding solution involves leveraging word embeddings to enhance search results by considering contextual and semantic relationships between words. Evaluation demonstrates that OpenAI's text embedding model outperforms alternative options.

## Motivation

Given the surge in research related to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems, effective collaboration among researchers within specific subdomains of artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly crucial. The website is designed to bridge this need by facilitating connections between researchers from various faculties at Carleton University and problem owners, all with the goal of promoting collaboration in research.

The ongoing development of the website employs an innovative web scraping strategy using Beautiful Soup, a Python tool for parsing HTML documents. This technique enables the extraction of data from diverse Carleton faculty pages. The collected information is stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format within Firebase's real-time database. This dataset encompasses details like researchers' contact information, research interests, publications, and their respective affiliations. The website's front end was built using React, TailWindCSS, and a few DaisyUI components to create an easy-to-use user interface.

With the vision of creating a platform for problem owners to connect with researchers, the website must effectively perform as a comprehensive database with an intelligent search function. This entails robust search and querying capabilities that can interpret user intent and provide relevant outcomes. The initial state of the website employed a rudimentary search algorithm, specifically the exact-match keyword search. The objective of this project was to enhance the effectiveness of the search function. This can be achieved through numerous sophisticated search algorithms such as fuzzy search, page-rank search (Google's primary search algorithm), natural-language search, semantic search, and more. Given the maturity of research and application in natural language processing (NLP), this project will focus on improving the website's search functionality through NLP techniques such as natural-language search and semantic search [Rajput, 2020].

Semantic search transcends the limitations of exact keyword matches by comprehending each search query's context and underlying meaning. Implementing a semantic search algorithm can help identify correlated concepts and synonyms, resulting in more pertinent outcomes aligned with user intent. It heavily relies on word embeddings, a fundamental NLP concept, to grasp queries and deliver similar results that might be phrased differently. Word embeddings represent words as numerical vectors in a multidimensional space, where the angle or distance between vectors signifies the semantic proximity of words [Sieg, 2019].

The project's objective revolves around enhancing the website's existing search capabilities by integrating semantic search and natural language search algorithms. This will significantly enrich user experience and empower problem owners and researchers to more effectively collaborate and advance ethical AI research.

## Methodology

### System Architecture

A web application can be categorized into two primary functionalities: the front end and the back end. The front end encompasses the visual components that users interact with, while the back end is responsible for managing the website's structure, data, and logic.

The design approach for this project was strongly influenced by the inherent nature of the final web application. A critical requirement was to ensure compatibility with a React front-end application while delivering prompt and precise search results. To achieve this, a backend Application Programming Interface (API) was developed, enabling seamless communication between the front end and back end.

Another influence on the software architecture stemmed from the work of a previous student who created a web scraper. This tool extracted information from diverse faculty web pages, including names, departments, contact details, and research interests. The collected data was then transformed into JSON format and uploaded to Firebase's Realtime Database, accessible via API calls. These calls encompass actions such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting dataâ€”collectively referred to as CRUD actions. This client-server interaction entails the client sending requests to the server, which responds with the required data or an error message.

This laid the foundation for developing a solution. With parsed data residing in Firebase's Realtime Database, the ReactJS-based front end, and the need for a versatile backend API, Python emerged as the language of choice. Python's capabilities extended to seamless Firebase communication, a diverse array of data manipulation tools, Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. It also offered simple backend server hosting through the Flask web framework.

### Tokenization
Tokenization, a fundamental process, involves dissecting text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, subwords, or even characters. For instance, consider the sentence "The quick fox jumped over the lazy dog." In this context, each word constitutes a token, and within each word, individual letters serve as tokens. Consequently, text is parsed into paragraphs, paragraphs into sentences, sentences into words, and words into letters. This breakdown facilitates preprocessing, enabling us to focus solely on the pertinent content. The tokenization at the character level assumes particular significance, as it empowers the removal of punctuation and extraneous symbols. Tokenizing at the word level, on the other hand, permits the identification of keywords while excluding insignificant words such as articles (a, the) and prepositions. The division of paragraphs into sentences aids in grasping the holistic narrative by identifying meaningful phrases. As part of preprocessing, both our corpus and search query underwent punctuation and stop word removal prior to executing exact match searches. The ensuing search methods encompassed exact match searches for the entire query, bigram exact match searches, and trigram exact match searches. The latter two techniques fall under the umbrella of tokenization's subcategory known as n-grams [Pai, 2020]

### N-Grams
In natural language processing, n-grams are contiguous sequences of n items, where an "item" can refer to a word, character, or even a subword. N-grams capture local linguistic patterns and contextual information within a text [Pai, 2020]. They are very useful for identifying the keywords and phrases within a text. The "n" in n-grams represents the number of items in the sequence. A sentence like "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" serves as an illustrative example. Depending on the chosen "n" value, the following n-grams emerge:

1. Unigrams (1-grams):
   - "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."

2. Bigrams (2-grams):
   - "The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox", "fox jumps", "jumps over", "over the", "the lazy", "lazy dog."

3. Trigrams (3-grams):
   - "The quick brown", "quick brown fox", "brown fox jumps", "fox jumps over", "jumps over the", "over the lazy", "the lazy dog."

The utility of n-grams extends across numerous NLP tasks, including information retrieval. A devised algorithm facilitated the culling of bigrams and trigrams from the tokenized search query, which underwent preprocessing involving stop word elimination and punctuation removal. This iterative approach heightened the precision of exact match searches by accounting for partial query matches within the corpus.

### Semantic Search Algorithm and Text Embedding Models
Having established the system architecture overview, the focus shifted to devising an effective search algorithm. Thorough research was conducted to explore potential solutions for refining the search functionality. The primary goal was to enhance the search bar's ability to comprehend user intent. This involved utilizing a trained NLP model for query analysis and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the corpusâ€”the data being searched. Once the user's intent was deciphered, the challenge lay in locating relevant information. This was achieved by parsing JSON data to identify exact, partial, and related matches based on the query. Ultimately, the search results need to be presented in a manner that is ranked according to query relevance.

Initially, a plan was formulated to use SpaCy, an open-source NLP Python library, for text embedding. This approach entailed leveraging pre-trained word-vectorization methods to calculate embeddings for the corpus. However, further exploration revealed that SpaCy utilized Word2Vec, a technique dating back to 2013 [Mikolov et al, 2013]. Given the rapid evolution of AI/ML and NLP research in the past decade, this represented a limitation.

Upon deeper investigation, two promising text embedding models emerged: the OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model and the HuggingFace instructor-xl model [Su et al, 2022]. The decision-making process on which model to employ was facilitated by the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The MTEB indicated that the instructor-xl model ranked seventh, while the text-embedding-ada-002 model secured the thirteenth position overall [Muennighoff et al, 2022].

To make a more informed choice, a minimum viable solution was implemented using research interest data for each faculty member from Firebase's Realtime Database as the corpus. Embeddings were calculated and stored locally for each research interest using both models. Fifteen test queries were generated to establish a baseline for evaluation.

The embeddings for each query and corpus, represented as numerical vectors, allowed relevance calculation using the cosine similarity equation. The below image (Figure 2) represents a multidimensional space where two vectors "Hi world" and "Hello world" lie. Using the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, we can interpret the distance between them or in other words, how closely related the two vectors are. This produces a numeric value between 0 and 1, where 1 signifies an exact match, and 0 suggests no relevance between the vectors.

Cosine similarity is calculated using the equation:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \cdot \|B\|}
\]
where:
\[
A &= \text{Vector } A \\
B &= \text{Vector } B \\
\|A\| &= \text{Magnitude of vector } A \\
\|B\| &= \text{Magnitude of vector } B
\]

### Ranking Algorithm
Once a model was identified as the superior solution for our domain-specific task, a ranking algorithm was developed to provide the most pertinent information as top suggestions, prior to transmitting our results from the back end to the front end. This was accomplished through a hierarchy of rules: Exact matches were given priority over semantically similar ones. A tri-gram exact match took precedence over semantically similar search results for search phrases containing more than three words. To illustrate, consider the query "NLP for mining software repositories." The search process would begin with an exact match search for the entire query, followed by each bigram: "NLP for","for mining", "mining software", "software repositories"; followed by each trigram: "NLP for mining," "mining for software," and "mining software repositories." After exhausting the exact match search, the outcomes of the semantically similar search were appended to the results. This method ensures that only the most pertinent search results appear at the forefront.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines
In order to ensure that the website's search functionality works seamlessly, a back end server built using the Flask Python web framework would be hosted and deployed on the cloud-based micro-web service called Render. Render facilitates API hosting, enabling multiple endpoints to communicate with the back-end server through a single URL. On of the advantages of using a micro web service such as Render is that our code base can sit on a local machine while our deployment is over the cloud. This allows us to use version control tools such as git/GitHub to manage the different development, staging and production code without breaking our connection between the back end the front end. Anytime we commit new code to our production branch on GitHub, Render will automatically deploy the new code to the production server. Lastly, in order to update the embeddings on the database, a python script will be run when any of the faculty member's research interest changes. This ensures that the corpus is up to date.
